## How to see it in action

Just serve up the www/ folder using any web server you'd like. To get you set
up quickly, we include a node.js static file server. Start the server by typing
`node server.js` from the command line, and then go to
[localhost:8888/html/example.html](http://localhost:8888/html/example.html) in
your browser.
